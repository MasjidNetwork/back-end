# API Standardization Implementation

This document outlines the standardization changes implemented in the Masjid Network API to ensure consistency, maintainability, and future extensibility.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. API Versioning

We've implemented URL-based versioning for all API endpoints:

- **Before**: `/api/resource`
- **After**: `/api/v1/resource`

This change allows us to:
- Make breaking changes in future versions without affecting existing clients
- Support multiple API versions simultaneously during transition periods
- Clearly communicate API lifecycle stages

### 2. Standardized Response Format

All API responses now follow a consistent format:

#### Success Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "meta": {
    "pagination": { ... }
  }
}
```

#### Error Response

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human-readable error message",
    "details": { ... }
  },
  "timestamp": "2023-07-15T12:34:56.789Z",
  "path": "/api/v1/resource"
}
```

### 3. Standardized Error Codes

We've implemented a consistent error code system:

| Error Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| AUTH_001 | Authentication required |
| AUTH_002 | Invalid credentials |
| AUTH_003 | Insufficient permissions |
| VALIDATION_001 | Invalid input data |
| RESOURCE_001 | Resource not found |
| RESOURCE_002 | Resource already exists |
| PAYMENT_001 | Payment processing error |

### 4. Implementation Details

The standardization was implemented through:

1. **Global Prefix**: Updated `main.ts` to set the global API prefix to `api/v1`

2. **Transform Interceptor**: Created a global interceptor that transforms all successful responses to follow our standard format:
   - `src/common/interceptors/transform.interceptor.ts`

3. **HTTP Exception Filter**: Updated the exception filter to format all error responses consistently:
   - `src/common/filters/http-exception.filter.ts`

4. **Swagger Documentation**: Updated the Swagger setup to reflect the new versioning and response format:
   - Updated endpoint to `/api/v1/docs`
   - Added documentation about the standardized response format

## Benefits

These standardization changes provide several benefits:

1. **Consistency**: All API endpoints now behave predictably with consistent response formats
2. **Client Development**: Frontend developers can rely on consistent response handling
3. **Error Handling**: Standardized error codes make debugging and error handling more straightforward
4. **Future-Proofing**: Versioning allows for API evolution without breaking existing clients
5. **Documentation**: The standardized format is self-documenting and easier to understand

## Migration Guide

For any existing clients using the API, the following changes are required:

1. Update all API endpoint URLs to include the `/v1/` segment
2. Update response handling to extract data from the `data` property
3. Update error handling to check the `success` flag and extract error details from the `error` property

## Next Steps

1. **Client Libraries**: Consider creating client libraries that handle the standardized format automatically
2. **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring for API usage by version to track adoption
3. **Deprecation Strategy**: Develop a formal process for deprecating and sunsetting API versions
